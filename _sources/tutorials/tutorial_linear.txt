Linear regression
------------------

Linear regressions are commonly used to perform genome-wide association
studies. It is possible to perform such an analysis using imputation data
(dosage format), where each imputed genotypes varies between 0 and 2
(inclusively). A value close to 0 means that a homozygous genotype of the most
frequent allele is the most probable. A value close to 2 means that a
homozygous genotype of the rare allele is the most probable. Finally, a value
close to 1 means that a heterozygous genotype is the most probable.

We suppose that you have followed the main :ref:`gwip-tut-page`. The following
command will create the working directory for this tutorial.

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir -p $HOME/gwip_tutorial/linear


.. _lin-tut-input-files:

Input files
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Imputed genotypes
""""""""""""""""""

After running the :py:mod:`gwip` pipeline, the imputed genotypes files will
have the ``.impute2`` or ``.impute2.gz`` extension Those files will be located
in the ``final_impute2`` directories of each chromosomes. There should be one
*impute2* file per chromosome (see the
:ref:`gwip-tut-output-files-final_impute2` section in the main
:ref:`gwip-tut-page`). These files consist of the imputed genotypes required to
perform the analysis.

The general structure of the file contains the following columns (which are
space delimited): the chromosome, the name of the marker, its position and its
two alleles. The subsequent columns correspond to the probabilities of each
genotype (hence, there are three columns per sample). The first value
correspond to the probability of being homozygous of the first allele. The
second value correspond to the probability of being heterozygous. Finally, the
third value correspond to the probability of being homozygous of the second
allele. The following example shows two lines of the *impute2* file.

.. code-block:: text

    21 rs376366718:10000302:A:G 10000302 A G 0.986 0.014 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 ...
    21 21:10002805:C:T 10002805 C T 0.254 0.736 0.010 0.810 0.188 0.002 0.800 0.195 0.005 ...


Samples file
"""""""""""""

This file is generated by :py:mod:`gwip` and has the ``.sample`` extension.
There should be one sample file per chromosome (see the
:ref:`gwip-tut-output-files-final_impute2` section in the main
:ref:`gwip-tut-page`). These files greatly resembles the *Plink* ``fam`` file.
Specifically, it contains the samples that are included in the *impute2* file
(with **the same order**). It is needed to correctly interpret the sample
described by the *impute2* file. The format is as follow:

.. code-block:: text

   ID_1 ID_2 missing father mother sex plink_pheno
   0 0 0 D D D B
   1341 NA06985 0 0 0 2 -9
   1341 NA06991 0 NA06993 NA06985 2 -9
   1341 NA06993 0 0 0 1 -9
   ...

The first two rows are part of the format and should be as is.

.. warning::

   The column ``ID_2`` should contain **unique** sample identification numbers,
   since the analysis will only consider the ``ID_2`` (which correspond to the
   sample ID in the *Plink* file) to correctly match the samples and the
   imputed genotypes.


Phenotype file
"""""""""""""""

This file describes the phenotype and variables used to perform the linear
regression. The file is *tab* separated and contains one row per sample, one
column per phenotype/variable.

The following is an example of a phenotype file:

.. code-block:: text

   SampleID	Pheno1	Age	Var1	Gender
   NA06985	58.6923101992	53	48.0104314206	2
   NA06993	64.8981628053	47	23.7615117523	1
   NA06994	129.562482664	48	20.2946857226	1
   ...

We provide a *dummy* phenotype file (where values, except for ``Gender``, were
randomly generated for 60 founders of the dataset). The following command
should download the phenotype file.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd $HOME/gwip_tutorial/linear

   wget http://pgxcentre.github.io/gwip/_static/tutorial/phenotypes_linear.txt.bz2
   bunzip2 phenotypes_linear.txt.bz2 

.. note::

   Note that the gender is encoded such that males are ``1`` and females are
   ``2``. Missing gender is encoded as ``0``.

.. warning::

   The sample identification numbers should match the ones in the sample file
   (see above). Those numbers should be unique for each sample. Only the
   samples that are **both** in the sample and phenotype files will be kept for
   analysis. The order of the samples in the phenotype file is not important.


Sites to extract (optional)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This file (which is optional) should contain a list of site (one identification
number per line) to keep for the analysis. This file might be the
``.good_sites`` file automatically generated by :py:mod:`gwip` (see the
:ref:`gwip-tut-output-files-final_impute2` section in the main
:ref:`gwip-tut-page`).


.. _lin-tut-execute:

Executing the analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you followed the :ref:`gwip-tut-page`, the following commands should execute
the linear regression analysis.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd $HOME/gwip_tutorial/linear
   
   imputed-stats linear \
       --impute2 ../gwip/chr22/final_impute2/chr22.imputed.impute2.gz \
       --sample ../gwip/chr22/final_impute2/chr22.imputed.sample \
       --pheno phenotypes_linear.txt \
       --extract-sites ../gwip/chr22/final_impute2/chr22.imputed.good_sites \
       --nb-process 8 \
       --nb-lines 6000 \
       --gender-column Gender \
       --covar Age,Var1,Gender \
       --sample-column SampleID \
       --pheno-name Pheno1

For more information about the arguments and options, see the
:ref:`lin-tut-usage` section. The number of process to use might differ
according to the installation type and to the computer/server. See the
:ref:`lin-tut-execution-time` section for more information.

.. note::

   Analysis will be performed only on samples whitout missing data (phenotype,
   gender, variables, etc).

   By default, the analysis is performed by removing low quality genotypes
   (using a probability threshold of 0.9, the ``--prob`` option).


.. _lin-tut-output-files:

Output files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There will be two output files: ``.linear.dosage`` will contain the statistics,
and ``.log`` will contain the execution log.


``.linear.dosage`` file
""""""""""""""""""""""""

This file contains the results from the linear regression. It shows the
following information:

* ``chr``: the chromosome.
* ``pos``: the position on the chromosome.
* ``snp``: the name of the marker.
* ``major``: the major allele.
* ``minor``: the minor allele.
* ``maf``: the frequency of the minor allele.
* ``n``: the number of samples that were used for this marker.
* ``coef``: the coefficient.
* ``se``: the standard error.
* ``lower``: the lower value of the 95% confidence interval.
* ``upper``: the upper value of the 95% confidence interval.
* ``t``: the *t*-statistic.
* ``p``: the *p*-value.

.. note::

   By default, the statistics are computed only for markers with a minor allele
   frequency of 1% and higher. Markers with lower MAF will have ``NA`` values.
   To modify this behavior, use the ``--maf`` option.


.. _lin-tut-usage:

.. _lin-tut-execution-time:

Execution time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following figure shows the approximate execution time for different number
of processes (the ``--nb-process`` option) with different installation methods
(*pyvenv* in blue, versus *miniconda* in orange). This analysis was performed
on a computer with an *Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz* (8 cores) and
16Go of RAM. The analysis contained the 195,473 imputed markers and 90 samples
from the previous command (where phenotypes were available for only 60 of the
samples). Each test was performed only one time (no repetition).

.. _linear_exec_time:

.. figure:: ../_static/images/Linear_Walltime.png
    :align: center
    :width: 60%
    :alt: Linear regression execution time vs number of processes.

Note that the linear regression from *Statsmodels 0.6.1* (at least when
compiled on a modern Linux system, *i.e.* when :py:mod:`gwip` is installed
using the *pyvenv* method) uses more than 100% of each process, hence we
recommend testing with *n/2* processes (where *n* is the number of processing
cores on the machine) and monitor the system load average. This is not true
when using a *miniconda* installation, since all processes uses no more than
100%.

.. note::

   Execution times between *Plink* and :py:mod:`gwip` were compared for this
   analysis. When data processing is required prior to the statistical analysis
   (*e.g.* removing poor quality genotypes and excluding the 60 samples without
   phenotype), *Plink* was **significantly faster** than :py:mod:`gwip`, even
   if the latter is using more than one processes. This is due to prior data
   manipulation, which significantly increse computation time.

   When no data processing is required (*i.e.* keeping bad quality genotypes
   and keeping all samples), :py:mod:`gwip` was faster with two processes or
   more (as in the figure below). Note that for this example (30,000 imputed
   markers for 2,402 samples), all samples were used for the analysis because
   they all had a phenotype.

.. _lin-tut-comparison:

Results comparison
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The linear regression results from :py:mod:`gwip` and *Plink* were compared for
validity. The following figure shows the comparison for, from left to right,
the coefficients, the standard errors and the *p*-values. The *x* axis shows
the results from :py:mod:`gwip`, and the *y* axis shows the results for
*Plink*. This comparison includes 163,670 "good" imputed markers, analyzed for
60 samples (*i.e* results from this tutorial). Note that for this comparison,
the **probability threshold** (``--prob``) **was changed from 0.9 to 0** to
*imitate* *Plink* analysis (see note below for more information).

.. figure:: ../_static/images/Linear_Diff_Prob0.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%
   :alt: Linear regression comparison between gwip and Plink (probability of 0)

.. note::

   The sign of the coefficients might be different when comparing
   :py:mod:`gwip` to *Plink*, since :py:mod:`gwip` computes the statistics on
   the rare allele, while *Plink* computes them on the second (alternative)
   allele. The alternative allele might not always be the rarest.

.. note::

   By default, :py:mod:`gwip` excludes samples with a maximum probability lower
   than 0.9 (the ``--prob`` option), while *Plink* keeps all the samples for
   the analysis. In order to get the same results as *Plink*, the analysis must
   be done with a probability threshold of 0 (*i.e.* ``--prob 0``, keeping all
   imputed genotypes including those with poor quality). This is what was done
   for the previous figure.

   The following figure shows the comparison between *Plink* and :py:mod:`gwip`
   for the same analysis, but using the default probability threshold of 0.9
   (excluding imputed genotypes with poor quality).
